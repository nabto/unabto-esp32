> **Warning**
> Deprecation notice: This project is based on the now deprecated uNabto platform, hence this project is no longer actively maintained. The Nabto 4/Micro (uNabto) platform has been superseded by Nabto 5/Edge (see our [comparsion of the two platforms](https://docs.nabto.com/developer/guides/overview/edge-vs-micro.html)). An officially supported SDK for ESP32 is [available in github](https://github.com/nabto/edge-esp32). Also, see our [guide to using Nabto Edge with ESP32](https://docs.nabto.com/developer/platforms/embedded/esp32.html).

# uNabto ESP32 EVB Heatpump Stub 

This project turns the ESP32 EVB into a Nabto/AppMyProduct heatpump stub demo. It uses the esp-idf FreeRTOS based core (vs. some other demos which uses the arduino core).

# The structure

The structure of the project is as follows
<pre>

    +
    +-->+-------------+
    |   |    Main     |        This folder contains the initial setup
    |   +-------------+        and the application_event() function defining
    |                          the application
    +-->+-------------+
        |  Components |
        +-------------+

</pre>


ESP-IDF project has a speciel structure. You can read more about that here:
https://esp-idf.readthedocs.io/en/v1.0/build_system.html
The unabto source and the integration code is done as components and therefore resides in the IDF component folder.
The unabto sdk is a submodule link to the unabto generic source.

The initial setup/commisioning and the application is located in the main folder.
unabto_application.c contains the application (inside the application_event function), the main.c contains the setup and configuration of the WiFi module.


# How to set it up

## Step 1: Setup the ESP-IDF build environment

Follow the setup of the ESP-IDF toolchain setup

http://esp-idf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get-started/index.html

## Step 2: Clone the repository


```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/nabto/unabto-esp32.git
```

## Step 3: Make menuconfig

Enter into menu "Custom configuration"

Edit/adjust the following menu items:


* WIFI access point name (SSID) : The wifi access point you want the module to attach to
* WIFI password : The password used by the access point
* Nabto ID : The Nabto device id you get from your AppMyProduct account
* Nabto key - 32 hex chars : The key for the specific device id you entered in the before mentioned item


## Step 3: Build the project

```
make
```

## Step 4: Flash the Image

Possible you need to adjust the serial deivce to use for flashing which is setup in the menuconfig part, but mostly the standard setup will match your platform.

```
make flash
```


# How to test the application



## Monitor the output from the board

Using the monitor command you should see a printout similar to the following every time the ESP32-EVB starts up:


```
~/dev/unabto-esp32$ make monitor
MONITOR
--- idf_monitor on /dev/cu.wchusbserial1420 115200 ---
